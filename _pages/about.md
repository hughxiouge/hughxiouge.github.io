I currently work as an AI/ML resident at Apple Inc. I'm in Siri Conversation Intelligence team where I work on dialog understanding. I have also worked in Apple Knowledge Platform to research on Large Language Model Knowledge Editing.

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. from [Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/), University of Southern California. My advisor was [Prof. C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://mcl.usc.edu/people/cckuo/). Prior to joining USC, I received my B.S. and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Illinois Urbana Champaign in 2016 and 2018 respectively. My research interests include Knowledge Graphs (KG), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), Generative AI, AI for Social Good.
