I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/), University of Southern California, supervised by [Prof. C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh) in [Media Communication Lab](https://mcl.usc.edu/). Prior to joining USC, I received my B.S. and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Illinois Urbana Champaign in 2016 and 2018 respectively. My research interests include Knowledge Graphs (KG), Natural Language Processing (NLP).
